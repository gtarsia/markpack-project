# markpack-project

This is a skeleton for using markpack.

Use this by cloning it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zzyyxxww/markpack-project <your_name_here>
cd <your_name_here>
# You can rm -rf .git
```

Write your stuff on the `src/` directory and serve your files with:

```bash
npm run serve
```

When you want to publish your changes, you can run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles your files into the `build/` directory.
